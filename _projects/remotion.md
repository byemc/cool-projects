Remotion, at it's core, is a video editor for programmers. You punch code into your computer and the computer spits out a video. Not being someone who uses React (the only JS here is used for Font Awesome), I haven't actually played around with Remotion too much, but the concept is *really* cool.

For example, you can have the user type in their GitHub username, render it on the server, and send back a video with their avatar and follower count. This is actually the demo on [their site](https://remotion.dev/) (scroll down a bit).

If you're looking to get started with Remotion, I'd suggest you look at [Fireship's tutorial](https://youtu.be/deg8bOoziaE), which is recommended by the devs themselves.
